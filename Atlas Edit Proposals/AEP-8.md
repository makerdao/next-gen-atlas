## Motivation

With DAI and USDS already present and profitable on Ethereum, resources to promote USDS are best spent on new markets. To this end, the Integration Boost program should direct 100% of its budget to venues and partners outside of Ethereum and it's associated L2's where there is the highest potential for growth. 

To add, Sky is quite profitable but much of this is currently being spent rather than given back to token holders. Integration boosts should be focused on high value returns. Realistically almost all Sky income is derived from Ethereum as low gas means the L2's have lost much of their meaning/drive. Benefits gained from L2 network deposits are only driven by large subsidies such that Sky is losing out overall. A great example is on Compound, sure it's great that people are depositing USDS and borrowing USDS on compound. But we're paying USDS incentives to achieve this. They can just deposit USDS on Sky. Perhaps when USDS was unknown it was good publicity (people see the high APR and google USDS to find it) but now USDS is known so we no longer need efforts such as this on ETH.

## Edited Atlas Documents

Sections shall be amended as below (changes in **bold** or ~~strikethrough~~):

A.2.3.8.2.2.1.1 - Integration Boost Partners
CORE

The Integration Boost is provided to DeFi protocol partners **outside Ethereum and it's various L2's/sidechains** that allow users to deposit USDS balances. Sky makes payments to Integration Boost partners equal to the Sky Savings Rate times the Unrewarded USDS balances in their protocol. The expectation is that the Integration Boost Partner will pass these Integration Boost Payments along to their users, thus providing USDS users with the equivalent of the Sky Savings Rate. **The rewards shall be no more than 1% of Sky income for the time period (based on the preceding time period). For example, if in the past 60 days Sky made $100,000, the rewards can be no more than $1000 over 60 days.**
