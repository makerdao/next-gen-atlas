## Motivation

To enhance communication, transparency, and cohesion among the DAO and better keep things organized I am proposing to adopt a system similar to most DAOs/ETH-style governance and have monthly discord meetings. This would not just be for Sky DAO but for the sub-DAO's as well to attend so that everyone is up to date on what is going on and have a chance to interact. These meetings will be recorded and posted to Youtube so that future users may look up past decisions/discussions. How I envision this working is that every month there is a meeting of all Sky employees where they can discuss what is going on and communicate between themselves while the audience is muted. AD's will be required to attend 1 in 3 meetings, missing 3 in a row results in disqualification. Once the employees are done, the AD's will be able to ask questions and discuss monthly governance proposals. Once the AD's are finished, there will be a 20 minute question period for the community to ask questions. I will note that all other organizations wishing to cooperate with Sky must ask on the forum, this would not be a period for advertising. Edit: To add, AD's can write down their questions they don't need to talk (due to the anonymity requirements for AD's).

## Edited Atlas Documents

Sections shall be amended as below (changes in **bold** or strikethrough):

### **Updating Documentation Regarding Standby Spells**

* **Add** `A.1.14/###**2.15 - Monthly Community Meeting:**
 A monthly public meeting will be held on discord or another alternative venue for Sky's staff, volunteers, AD's and community members. Staff will have a chance to meet and discuss ongoing projects/initiatives. The AD's will have a chance to ask questions and Atlas proposals. Finally the community will have a chance to ask questions for a minimum of 20 minutes. This meeting will be recorded and uploaded to a streaming service such as Youtube.

**Replace** `#### 2.4.2: Alignment Conservers Eligibility Requirements

Alignment Conservers must always act to preserve the spirit of the Atlas Immutable Alignment Artifact and to fight against, and make public, all forms of corruption, organizational drift and other misalignment threats that they discover from their embedded position near the inner workings of MakerDAO. They must be held to a high standard in terms of acting with Universal Alignment.` to read as follows:
