This approach allows the rule's exact wording, even if flawed or misaligned with its goals, to dictate the result, particularly if it benefits the interpreter.</p><p>A "spirit of the rule" interpretation seeks to comprehend the rule's true purpose and how it contributes to Universal Alignment, while remaining bound by the letter of the rule. When faced with inconsistencies or errors in the rule's language, this approach appeals to a pre-established method for disabling, disregarding or substituting the rule as needed to prevent outcomes that contradict its intended objective and the greater purpose it serves.</p><p>Example:</p><p>Imagine a large corporation discovers a loophole in the environmental regulation of its jurisdiction that allows them to generate profits by using a specific type of pollutant that isn't regulated as a greenhouse gas, but is as harmful as regulated greenhouse gasses.</p><p>By exploiting the "letter of the rule," the corporation complies with the regulations on paper but continues to harm the environment and public health in practice.</p><p>A universally aligned actor, such as an environmentally conscious competitor, would interpret the regulations based on their "spirit" or underlying purpose - protecting the environment and public health. Recognizing that exploiting the loophole contradicts the regulations' intent, the universally aligned actor would voluntarily choose not to emit the harmful pollutant, even though doing so might be profitable and technically legal. A universally aligned actor would also actively work with the government and other stakeholders to close the loophole and strengthen the regulations to ensure that they effectively serve their intended purpose, and to protect themselves from misaligned competitors.</p></td>

All Sky Primitive Process Definitions are structured according to a common data schema - a set of fields that describe when they can start, how they run step by step, and what they must input or produce upon completion. The documents herein define this data schema for Sky Primitive Process Definitions, which are applied to the universal specifications for each Sky Primitive. This common data schema aligns the entire ecosystem, while each Agent Artifact automatically references and extends the universal rules to incorporate the Agent's unique Instance-level strategies, parameters and document-driven process flows. At present, only the Accessibility Reward Primitive and the Integration Boost Primitive specifications are structured using this schema. In future iterations of the Atlas, the schema will be applied to all Primitive specifications in this Article.</td>

In practice, each Agent has its own Instance of that Document type in its Artifact.

           The Upkeep Rebate Primitive allows a Star Agent (”Holding Agent”) to claim a rebate on its Ecosystem Upkeep Fees when it holds any portion of the token supply of another Star Agent (”Issuing Agent”). Ecosystem Upkeep Fees are accounted on a monthly basis. The Upkeep Rebate is calculated on the same cadence per Holding Agent as follows: (1) The Holding Agent’s share of the Issuing Agent’s token supply at the time the Issuing Agent pays its Ecosystem Upkeep Fees, multiplied by (2) The total monthly Ecosystem Upkeep Fees paid by the Issuing Agent. For a Star Agent deploying the Distribution Requirement Primitive, the value of its total monthly Ecosystem Upkeep Fee is calculated pursuant to <dfn>A.2.4 - Calculation of Distributed Tokens</dfn>. For a Star Agent deploying the Market Cap Fee Primitive, the value of its total monthly Ecosystem Upkeep Fee is calculated pursuant to <dfn>A.2.4 - Valuation</dfn>.

In the long term, Operational GovOps assumes responsibility for ensuring that the data submission meets the on-chain verifiability requirement; this is done as part of their review of Invocations of the Integration Boost Primitive.

            In the long term, Operational GovOps calculates the Integration Boost for each occurrence of the specified Cadence. Operational GovOps then pays the Integration Boost recipient from its Buffer. Later, Sky Core reimburses the Operational Agent Buffer for the amount paid as part of the Settlement Cycle. This minimizes the role of Sky Core in Integration Boost payments and emphasizes the primary role of the Operational Executor Agent, acting through Operational GovOps, in implementing the Sky Primitives. The process is specified in further detail in <dfn>A.2.4 - Routine Protocol</dfn>.

          <td>Minimum Capabilities of Star TRC Management Systems</td>
          <td>Core</td>
          <td>A Star Agent's internal TRC management system should possess the following capabilities to meet the objectives outlined in <dfn>A.2.4 - Objective of Star TRC Management</dfn>.
            <ol>
              <li><p>Star Agents' internal TRC management systems should enable compliant sourcing and tracking of all TRC components, including Internal Junior Risk Capital (IJRC), Star-External Junior Risk Capital (SEJRC), Tokenized External Junior Risk Capital (TEJRC), and Originated Senior Risk Capital (OSRC). Compliance in this context includes strict adherence to eligibility criteria and capital-sourcing ratios (e.g., External Per Internal, Senior Per Junior) as defined in the Atlas. See <dfn>A.3.3 - Total Risk Capital Sourcing Ratios</dfn>.</p><p>The system must provide real-time or near real-time tracking of all held Total Risk Capital (TRC) components. This includes, for each TRC component:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Accurate valuation of the assets comprising each component.</li>
                  <li>Clear identification of the source of each component (e.g., Star's own SubProxy for IJRC, specific Ecosystem Accord references for rented SEJRC or OSRC, TEJRC encumbrance details, OSRC origination details).</li>
                  <li>Verification of each TRC component's eligibility status according to Atlas rules. This includes tracking whether capital is "enabled" or "active" for RRC coverage purposes (e.g., based on Ecosystem Accord status, compliance with sourcing ratios, etc.).</li>
                  <li>Distinction between capital directly held by the Star Agent and capital that is encumbered (e.g., SEJRC where the lending Star retains custody but the capital is contractually committed).</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Star Agents' internal TRC management systems should enable dynamic-state accounting. The system must account for TRC components that are in dynamic, pending, or off-chain states, as these can impact the true risk capital available to a Star Agent. This includes:
                <ul>
                  <li>Pending transactions such as SEJRC or OSRC rental Ecosystem Accords that have been committed to by the parties, but not yet codified in the Atlas.</li>
                  <li>Capital in transit, e.g., assets that are committed to be IJRC, but currently moving between chains via bridges or locked in Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) messages awaiting finality.</li>
                  <li>Operational expenditures funded by TRC components (typically IJRC), such as blockchain transaction fees, oracle service fees, audit costs, and other operational overhead that reduces available risk capital. The system should track these expenditures in real-time or near real-time.</li>
                  <li>Any off-chain factors that could impair the immediate deployability or availability of TRC components.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Star Agents' internal TRC management systems should enable continuous capital adequacy monitoring. The system must enable the near real-time comparison of the Star Agent's internally tracked and calculated TRC against its official Aggregate RRC, as obtained from the Sky Core RRC Dashboard/API. See <dfn>A.2.4 - Sky Core Required Risk Capital (RRC) Dashboard And API</dfn>. This core functionality is essential for the Star Agent to proactively monitor its capital adequacy, identify potential or actual TRC shortfalls, and make timely operational and capital management decisions to maintain compliance.</li>
              <li><p>Star Agents' internal TRC management systems should define a RRC-incident (e.g., TRC shortfall) response protocol. The system should enable internal alerting mechanisms that detect when a Star Agent's TRC approaches predefined internal buffer thresholds relative to its Aggregate RRC. See <dfn>A.3.3 - Risk Tolerance Ratio</dfn>. The system should also detect an actual shortfall where the Star Agent's held TRC falls below its Aggregate RRC.</p><p>Furthermore, Star Agent teams should establish and document internal processes for responding to such alerts. Such internal processes should include:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>internal escalation and assessment of the shortfall's cause and magnitude;</li>
                  <li>formulation of potential responses or corrective actions, which may include sourcing additional TRC, reducing risk-weighted exposures, or other measures;</li>
                  <li>internal decision-making framework for the evaluation of potential responses and selection of the most appropriate one; and</li>
                  <li>notifying any pertinent parties (Operational GovOps) as needed for the purpose of planning or implementing follow-up action.</li>
                </ol>
              Star Agent teams' internal decision-making framework may consider the economic trade-offs of various actions, including the strategic acceptance of penalties for a TRC shortfall where such an approach is determined to be economically advantageous compared to immediate rebalancing (e.g., avoiding excessive transaction costs or market impact).</li>

          <td><p>Star Agents are required to periodically submit TRC Reports to Core GovOps. This report serves a dual purpose. It provides a verifiable snapshot of the Star Agent's TRC composition and key capital ratios as of the end of the reporting period; and second, it provides a formal attestation regarding the Star Agent's maintenance of TRC at or above its dynamically changing Aggregate Required Risk Capital (RRC) throughout the entire reporting period. See <dfn>A.3.3 - Aggregate RRC</dfn>.</p><p>This comprehensive reporting, encompassing both an end-of-period statement and disclosures of any intra-period events affecting TRC, is essential. On-chain data alone (such as that captured by the planned OVRC system) cannot definitively prove the full eligibility and unimpaired availability of a Star Agent's capital position for continuous RRC coverage, nor can it capture all off-chain factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, whether assets are subject to Star-initiated off-chain contractual pledges, if the economic value or redeemability of its bridged assets is compromised by issues with their originating bridge, or if its assets are encumbered by derivative structures or other off-chain commitments that would impair their immediate use at any point during the period.</p><p>The TRC Report serves as an important basis for Core GovOps' verification procedures. This entails: 1) reconciling reported end-of-period TRC components against the Sky Atlas, on-chain data, and other relevant sources to validate the period-end capital position and adherence to Atlas-defined capital requirements; and 2) reviewing Star Agents' attestations and disclosures regarding its TRC management and any material events throughout the reporting period to assess continuous compliance with its dynamically changing Aggregate RRC. The outcome of this validation is a critical input for the monthly settlement cycles, which latter includes the determination and retroactive application of penalties for any identified discrepancies or violations of capital requirements during the period.</p><p>The long-term vision is for the Powerhouse system to enable the automation of TRC data aggregation and verification. The Powerhouse system will have capabilities such as directly querying Star Agent SubProxy accounts for IJRC assets, programmatically accessing and interpreting Ecosystem Accords recorded in the Atlas, interfacing with TEJRC and OSRC smart contract systems, and automatically applying Atlas-defined eligibility rules. See <dfn>A.2.4 - Continuous Monitoring Of On-chain Verifiable Risk Capital (OVRC)</dfn>. Even in this advanced state, the TRC Report, or a similar form of periodic attestation, may remain necessary to cover elements of TRC verification that are not fully able to be automated or require explicit Star Agent declaration.</p></td>

(2) The monthly Senior Risk Capital (SRC) origination process is settled: the clearing price is established, costs are deducted from winning Star Agents’ accounts, and their accounts are credited with Originated SRC (OSRC) for the upcoming month. See 3.3 - Settlement Of Origination. (3) Queued conversions between USDS and srUSDS within the SRC system are processed. See A.3.3 - Deposit And Redemption Queues. (4) Pioneer Incentive Pools are funded with an amount equivalent to the Sky Savings Rate applied to unrewarded USDS. See A.2.4 - Pioneer Chain Primitive. (5) The Smart Burn Buffer’s burning operation occurs synchronously with each Monthly Settlement Cycle. At each cycle, the system calculates the appropriate Burn Rate based on current market conditions and executes the burn operation, if applicable, according to the formula specified in the Atlas. See A.2.5 - Treasury Management - Treasury Management - Allocation Steps - Step 4: Smart Burn And Standard Activity Staking Rewards - Smart Burn Buffer - Usage Of Smart Burn Buffer.

These instruments will provide extended risk coverage for participants of the Sky Ecosystem and Agents. The object of the Policyholder is to • Act as a legal counterparty with insurance brokers, insurance, reinsurance, underwriters, or risk management companies.• Act as a policyholder of insurance contracts, which will have as beneficiaries participants of the Sky Ecosystem.• Hire suppliers and contractors necessary for the operation of self-insurance or insurance instruments, such as ◦ The Resilience Technical Committee for claim management ◦ Managers, Directors, and other executive staff of the legal vehicle. The power of directors will be limited to administrative and operative roles. Sky Governance will have all necessary control mechanisms over the Policyholder: • Sky Governance can designate and remove Directors, Supervisor, and Committees• Sky Governance can instruct the entity to act and ratify decisions• Power of directors is limited to administrative/operative roles• The Policyholder will not manage Sky's assets nor will be legally affiliated with Sky. The setup and operational budget of the legal vehicle will be sourced initially from the <dfn>A.2.9 - Legal Resilience - Legal Defense Resources - Resilience Fund Current Budget</dfn>. This is intended to move later to a separate budget.

            While the risk framework undergoes refinement, penalties for any Star Agent breaches of Required Risk Capital will be calculated by Core GovOps once the infrastructure is in place to do so. This calculation serves the purposes of system monitoring, data gathering, and framework calibration. However, throughout this interim phase, such calculated penalties will not be formally assessed against Star Agents, and consequently, Star Agents will not be required to make payment for these penalties. Notwithstanding this temporary exemption from penalty payment, Star Agents are expected to maintain a Risk Tolerance Ratio of at least 90%. See <dfn>A.3.3 - Risk Tolerance Ratio</dfn>.

            The Stability Fee parameter is an annual percentage fee charged on the Dai generated on Vaults. It is expressed as an annual percentage yield but it is charged on a per-block basis in Dai. The Dai from this fee is minted, added to the Dai debt for the vault, and then transferred into the Surplus Buffer which is under the control of Sky Governance. Each vault type has its own Stability Fee that can be adjusted by the Stability Facilitators. The Stability Facilitators must regularly update Vault Types' Stability Fee according to requirements defined in the subdocuments below. The Stability Scope Advisors must develop a Rate System which can be used to set various interest rates, including the rates for Core Crypto vaults and the minimum lending rate for future Agents. The Rate System must be based on external benchmarks including the risk-free rate and the highest current sustainable rate in crypto financial markets. These rates should act as the lowest and highest base rates to which additional spreads can be added to better reflect the risks involved in specific lending activities. The Rate System must be dynamic, based on the state of Actively Stabilizing Collateral in the system, and naturally move the state towards the required level of Actively Stabilizing Collateral defined in <dfn>A.3.4</dfn>.

            Periodically, collateral and vault types (ilks) are re-evaluated, which sometimes results in an offboarding of that collateral or vault type. There have been several instances where users entered official Sky forums/chats to understand why they had been suddenly liquidated, despite historically comfortable collateralization ratios (<a href="https://forum.makerdao.com/t/an-assessment-first-hand-experience-and-recommendations-from-the-aave-offboarding/11836">https://forum.makerdao.com/t/an-assessment-first-hand-experience-and-recommendations-from-the-aave-offboarding/11836</a>). This is, understandably, a poor user experience. Even with liquidation penalties set to 0%, the forced unwinding of levered positions conceivably can result in user losses, as well as potentially taxable events. This Section defines procedures concerning the dissemination of information about upcoming collateral offboarding on a best-effort basis. The objective is to minimize the number of users who are unaware of the offboarding prior to getting their positions liquidated.

            The Target Document fails to specify accountability measures for an AC who commits a misaligned act

            if an AC commits a subsequent misaligned act after an initial mild breach. The language does imply
            subsequent breaches should be treated with increasing severity.Despite the lack of explicit
            guidance, however, Facilitators have likely been given sufficient information in <dfn>A.1.4</dfn> to reach a
            reliable adjudication principle. Taken in its totality, the above cited Article requires
            Facilitators to take a highly aggressive stance when it comes to responding to AC misalignment risk.
            The absence of a substantial punitive measure for the first mild breach provides the AC with an
            opportunity for corrective action and learning. After the initial warning, any subsequent breach
            must immediately trigger derecognition, regardless of the degree of severity. Similarly, an initial
            breach that is not mild in scope or impact must trigger derecognition. This escalation is a
            necessary consequence of the Atlas's mandate that ACs are held to the highest standards of Universal
            Alignment.

            Governance Poll to allow SKY holders to vote on a revised version of the document that corrects the

            that the ecosystem can swiftly adapt to emerging challenges. Consequently, it is important at this

            instance: if two AEPs amend different sections of the Atlas but have implications that could lead to
            contradictory outcomes, how should the Governance Facilitators identify and address this indirect
            conflict?What if one AEP effects a significant overhaul of an Atlas document, while another effects
            minor tweaks to the same component? How do the Facilitators determine which elements of which AEP
            should take precedence?If one AEP drew more support than the other, does this automatically mean the
            former is the best update? What if the former AEP was authored by an unknown author, while the
            second AEP was authored by a well-known community member with high reputation?If merging proposals
            in this fashion becomes a common practice, what issues could arise? There is a risk of governance
            paralysis, where no significant progress can be made because of a loop of constant revisions and
            counter-revisions. Community fatigue could set in, where stakeholders become disengaged from the
            governance process due to the perception that decisions are never final. The continuous cycle of
            evaluating, merging, and discarding parts of conflicting AEPs is not only time-consuming but also
            increases the complexity of governance operations.If the Governance Facilitators merge parts of two
            approved, but conflicting AEPs, and the final merged product significantly deviates from the
            original intents of both, the representation of SKY voters' will becomes a compelling question.</td>

            evidence validation and evaluation, mechanisms for ensuring impartiality and objectivity, an appeals
            process, etc. The Atlas has made a good start with establishing an adjudication framework. There is
            some logic concerning procedures for how disputes and controversies (including Alignment Conserver
            misalignment) are brought forward and how they are reviewed. But essential elements are missing,
            such as protocols and standards for fact-finding and evidence. Needed Research here includes methods
            for implementing a structured fact-finding process that gathers relevant information impartially and
            comprehensively. Who has the authority to investigate, to request evidence, to handle evidence? What
            types of evidence are permissible to consider? See <dfn>Responsibly
              Provided - Whistleblower Evidence Of Misalignment Must Be Secured Ethically</dfn>. What are the
            processes for collecting, preserving, and analyzing this evidence? When should evidence be shared
            with the larger community and when should it be kept confidential? Then there is the matter of
            assessing evidence in a way that is rigorous and impartial, without which, confidence in the Atlas
            and the governance process may be undermined. What criteria should be used to validate and evaluate
            evidence to ensure its reliability and relevance in decision-making? This involves determining the
            credibility of sources, the reliability of evidence, and the relevance of information to the
            specific case. The research should explore different approaches to evidence evaluation, such as the
            application of the burden of proof, standards of proof (e.g., preponderance of evidence, beyond a
            reasonable doubt), and the use of experts. How much discretion should Facilitators have in
            interpreting and applying the element "the highest standard of Universal Alignment"? How to
            safeguard against bias and ensure all Facilitator adjudications are made impartially? Investigate
            mechanisms to maintain objectivity and impartiality throughout the adjudication, fact-finding, and
            evidence evaluation processes. This could include the establishment of independent review panels
            (which could operate post facto to avoid excessively delaying the deplatforming of misaligned ACs),
            the use of conflict-of-interest policies, and training on cognitive biases for those involved in
            decision-making.

This includes driving adoption of USDS and deploying collateral backing USDS at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Spark does this through the Spark Liquidity Layer, SparkLend, and Spark Savings.- The Spark Liquidity Layer directly provides USDS, sUSDS, and USDC liquidity across networks and DeFi markets.- SparkLend is a lending market focused on USDS borrowing, sourcing liquidity directly from Sky to provide the best borrow rates for USDS.- Spark Savings enables stablecoin holders to earn the best risk-adjusted rate in DeFi, at large scale, with minimal liquidity constraints.</td>

Utilization - the utilization itself.<br>The Base Rate, Slope 1, and Slope 2 parameters are further defined in: <dfn>Base Rate Definition</dfn>; <dfn>Slope 1 Definition</dfn>; and <dfn>Slope 2 Definition</dfn>. All markets except Dai use this IRM.

The calculations and payments must be done manually by the Support Facilitators at the end of each quarter. As an example: if, before the launch of Agent tokens, 200 million Dai is borrowed on Spark Protocol, then the virtual income is 1% of 200 million Dai, which gives 2 million Dai; and of that 2 million Dai the virtual revenue share is 200,000 Dai. This 200,000 Dai must be paid out in incremental payments each quarter directly by Sky Governance from the Sky Surplus Buffer to a smart contract under the control of Aave Governance. If, before the launch of Agent tokens, less than 100 million Dai is borrowed from Spark Protocol by the Sky Protocol, accrual towards the virtual revenue share payments are paused (unpaid virtual revenue share that already accrued is still paid out at the end of the quarter), and the counting down of the revenue share duration is paused. The virtual revenue share payments and the counting down of the remaining revenue share duration is resumed when at least 100 million Dai is again borrowed from Spark Protocol by the Sky Protocol. Once SPK tokens launch, the virtual revenue share system will be discontinued, and the standard rules of the Spark Protocol Aave Revenue Share Ecosystem Agreement shall take effect. See <dfn>Standard Agreement Post SPK Launch</dfn>.

The payments must occur for the revenue share duration of two (2) years, starting from September 25th, 2023. If at any point in time after the launch of Agent tokens, Spark Protocol is generating less than 1 million Dai per year in income for Spark Agent, accrual towards the revenue share payments are paused (unpaid revenue share that already accrued is still paid out at the end of the quarter), and the counting down of the revenue share duration is paused. The revenue share payments and the counting down of the remaining revenue share duration is resumed when Spark Protocol is generating more than 1 million Dai per year in income again.</td>

Users of the platform will receive an airdrop of SPK tokens, depending on how much and how long they have used the platform during the pre-launch token reward period. These rewards are only for users on Ethereum Mainnet. There are two seasons of the Spark pre-launch token rewards: Season 1 and Season 2. Season 1 of pre-launch token rewards was active from August 20 2023 and lasted for nine months, ending on May 20 2024. 130,434,783 SPK tokens were allocated in this period. In Season 2 14,478,261 SPK will be rewarded per month to SparkLend users who qualify for the airdrop. Season 2 is an additional pre-farming period, which runs until the Spark Agent launches as part of Sky Endgame launch season. The monthly SPK rewards are allocated as follows:◦ 80 % is allocated to users borrowing DAI and/or USDS◦ 20 % is allocated to users supplying ETHThe proposed full anti-cheat SPK Airdrop for SparkLend is calculated using the following formula:Airdrop = 80% * (DAI Borrows + USDS Borrows - sDAI Supplies * sDAI Liquidation Threshold - sUSDS Supplies * sUSDS Liquidation Threshold) + 20% * (ETH Supplies - ETH Borrows / ETH Liquidation Threshold)All supplies and borrows are denominated in USD based on the on-chain oracle price at that block to determine the conversion.</td>
