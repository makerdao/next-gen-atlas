          <td>Core</td>
          <td>The distinction between the "letter of the rule" and the "spirit of the rule" refers to whether an
            individual interprets and follows a rule strictly based on its precise wording, or instead also
            considers its underlying intent or larger purpose. The Universal Alignment Assumption holds that the
            underlying intent of rules always aims to serve human values and promote public benefit within a
            given context.A "letter of the rule" interpretation adheres strictly to the rule's language, often
            exploiting ambiguities or loopholes to achieve a specific outcome. This approach allows the rule's
            exact wording, even if flawed or misaligned with its goals, to dictate the result, particularly if
            it benefits the interpreter.A "spirit of the rule" interpretation seeks to comprehend the rule's
            true purpose and how it contributes to Universal Alignment, while remaining bound by the letter of
            the rule. When faced with inconsistencies or errors in the rule's language, this approach appeals to
            a pre-established method for disabling, disregarding or substituting the rule as needed to prevent
            outcomes that contradict its intended objective and the greater purpose it serves.Example:Imagine a
            large corporation discovers a loophole in the environmental regulation of its jurisdiction that
            allows them to generate profits by using a specific type of pollutant that isn't regulated as a
            greenhouse gas, but is as harmful as regulated greenhouse gasses.By exploiting the "letter of the
            rule," the corporation complies with the regulations on paper but continues to harm the environment
            and public health in practice.A universally aligned actor, such as an environmentally conscious
            competitor, would interpret the regulations based on their "spirit" or underlying purpose -
            protecting the environment and public health. Recognizing that exploiting the loophole contradicts
            the regulations' intent, the universally aligned actor would voluntarily choose not to emit the
            harmful pollutant, even though doing so might be profitable and technically legal. A universally
            aligned actor would also actively work with the government and other stakeholders to close the
            loophole and strengthen the regulations to ensure that they effectively serve their intended
            purpose, and to protect themselves from misaligned competitors.</td>

            Vote would leave the ecosystem vulnerable to harm (e.g., an exploit).<br> The multisig should be used to 
            prevent technical vulnerabilities; prevent unwanted functionality of the smart contracts or corresponding 
            parts of the system (e.g., price oracles); or prevent unwanted usage of the smart contracts or corresponding 
            parts of the system which deviates from intended behavior.<br> The multisig can also be used in cases where 
            a vulnerability or exploit is discovered in other protocols using the same codebase as SparkLend, and a 
            timely action can prevent or mitigate the damage.<br> The Governance Facilitators must ensure that use of 
            the multisig is generally aligned and specifically accords with the requirements defined herein.

            Voting depending on the topic. The voting period of a given Governance Poll varies; the most common
            are three (3) and fourteen (14) day periods. Concurrently-posted polls do not necessarily have the

            technical changes to the Sky Protocol.The Executive Vote occurs approximately every two weeks. Its
            contents are often determined by weekly Governance Polls that pre-approve the inclusion of proposals
            in the Executive Vote. However, the Atlas can explicitly authorize proposals to go directly to an
            Executive Vote.Note that the terms 'Executive' and 'spell' are distinct concepts. The term
            'Executive' or 'Executive Vote' is used in all instances where the formal governance vote is being
            referenced. The term 'Executive Process' refers to the end-to-end process of the development of an
            Executive Vote, in which Facilitators, spell teams (also referred to collectively as the "Governance
            Security Engineering Team") and other recognized Ecosystem Actors participate. The term 'spell'
            refers to the smart contract that executes the changes to the protocol approved by Sky Governance in
            an Executive Vote. Generally, when referring to spell team operations and their technical outcome or
            product (including code base, code operations, code reviews and code quality), the term 'spell' will
            be used. The term 'spell process' refers to the end-to-end process of developing a spell, a process
            in which the Governance Facilitators and the current spell team participate. The term 'spell
            development process' is a subset of the 'spell process' and pertains solely to the technical

From that point on, the Founder cannot add or edit Omni Documents, but can only Activate and Invoke specific Primitives so that the Agent can complete setup. See <dfn>A.2.4 - Agent Launch And Sequence of Primitive Global Activation</dfn>.

           The Upkeep Rebate Primitive allows a Star Agent (”Holding Agent”) to claim a rebate on its Ecosystem Upkeep Fees when it holds any portion of the token supply of another Star Agent (”Issuing Agent”). Ecosystem Upkeep Fees are accounted on a monthly basis. The Upkeep Rebate is calculated on the same cadence per Holding Agent as follows: (1) The Holding Agent’s share of the Issuing Agent’s token supply at the time the Issuing Agent pays its Ecosystem Upkeep Fees, multiplied by (2) The total monthly Ecosystem Upkeep Fees paid by the Issuing Agent. For a Star Agent deploying the Distribution Requirement Primitive, the value of its total monthly Ecosystem Upkeep Fee is calculated pursuant to <dfn>A.2.4 - Calculation of Distributed Tokens</dfn>. For a Star Agent deploying the Market Cap Fee Primitive, the value of its total monthly Ecosystem Upkeep Fee is calculated pursuant to <dfn>A.2.4 - Valuation</dfn>.

            In the long term, Operational GovOps calculates the Accessibility Reward for each month. Operational GovOps then pays the Accessibility Reward recipient from its Buffer. Later Sky Core reimburses the Operational Agent Buffer for the amount paid as part of the Settlement Cycle. This minimizes the role of Sky Core in Accessibility Reward payments and emphasizes the primary role of the Operational Executor Agent, acting through Operational GovOps, in implementing the Sky Primitives. The process is specified in further detail in <dfn>A.2.4 - Routine Protocol</dfn>.

            The Integration Boost is provided to DeFi protocol partners that allow users to deposit USDS balances. Sky makes payments to Integration Boost partners equal to the Sky Savings Rate times the Unrewarded USDS balances in their protocol. The expectation is that the Integration Boost Partner will pass these Integration Boost Payments along to their users, thus providing USDS users with the equivalent of the Sky Savings Rate. Integration Boost partners are part of the Integrator Program as defined in <dfn>A.2.4 - Integrator Program</dfn>. Current and onboarding Integrators are recorded in <dfn>A.2.4 - Current And Onboarding Integrators</dfn>.

In the short term, Ecosystem Actor BA Labs calculates the net deposit data based on on-chain events and makes it available to Operational GovOps through an API endpoint. The API endpoint is <a href="https://info-sky.blockanalitica.com/api/v1/incentivized-pools/">https://info-sky.blockanalitica.com/api/v1/incentivized-pools/</a> for Integration Boost Partners on Ethereum and <a href="https://info-sky.blockanalitica.com/api/v1/solana-incentives/">https://info-sky.blockanalitica.com/api/v1/solana-incentives/</a> on Solana. In the long term, Operational GovOps assumes responsibility for ensuring that the data submission meets the on-chain verifiability requirement; this is done as part of their review of Invocations of the Integration Boost Primitive.

Where: SCB = Current Stability Capital Buffer, TS = Total USDS supply,  TSCB = Target Stability Capital Buffer, RF = Retention Factor.<br>This formula dynamically adjusts capital retention based on the current buffer status: When SCB/TS equals TSCB (buffer at target), SCR equals zero. When SCB/TS is below TSCB, SCR increases proportionally to the shortfall. The maximum possible retention is capped by the Retention Factor (RF).<br>This ensures that capital retention automatically scales with urgency - the further the Stability Capital Buffer falls below its target percentage of total supply, the greater the portion of capital retained.<br>The parameters for calculating the SCR are further defined in the documents herein.</td>

            to be acting in a misaligned fashion. Misalignment can include maliciously exploiting the communication channel or disrupting
            its efficient functioning through improper use or antisocial behavior. However, unless egregiously misaligned or disrupting
            behavior takes place, responsible moderators should err on the side of charity and issue a public warning for users who engage
            in bad behavior before resorting to banning them. Egregiously misaligned or disrupting behavior includes spamming, flooding,
            threatening, or using inappropriate or abusive language. Only the Governance Facilitators may ban a user from the Sky Forum
            when doing so would operationally block an ongoing governance process (e.g. the user has submitted an otherwise eligible
            governance proposal).

            While its legacy ALM infrastructure is being transferred to Star Agents, Sky Core manages the portion of the Sky Collateral Portfolio not deployed by Star Agents ("Sky Core Collateral Portfolio"). During this transitional period, Sky Core must maintain, with respect to the Sky Core Collateral Portfolio, the same percentage of Actively Stabilizing Collateral and Demand Absorption Buffer required of Star Agents. The required percentages are specified in <dfn>A.3.4 - Minimum Actively Stabilizing Collateral</dfn>. This requirement remains in effect only until all legacy ALM infrastructure has been fully transitioned to Star Agents.

A PSM operates similarly to a regular vault type with a zero Stability Fee and a liquidation ratio of 100% that can only be accessed through a user-facing smart contract containing the relevant swap functions.

It is expressed as an annual percentage yield but it is charged on a per-block basis in Dai. The Dai from this fee is minted, added to the Dai debt for the vault, and then transferred into the Surplus Buffer which is under the control of Sky Governance. Each vault type has its own Stability Fee that can be adjusted by the Stability Facilitators. The Stability Facilitators must regularly update Vault Types' Stability Fee according to requirements defined in the subdocuments below. The Stability Scope Advisors must develop a Rate System which can be used to set various interest rates, including the rates for Core Crypto vaults and the minimum lending rate for future Agents. The Rate System must be based on external benchmarks including the risk-free rate and the highest current sustainable rate in crypto financial markets. These rates should act as the lowest and highest base rates to which additional spreads can be added to better reflect the risks involved in specific lending activities. The Rate System must be dynamic, based on the state of Actively Stabilizing Collateral in the system, and naturally move the state towards the required level of Actively Stabilizing Collateral defined in <dfn>A.3.4</dfn>.

            Periodically, collateral and vault types (ilks) are re-evaluated, which sometimes results in an offboarding of that collateral or vault type. There have been several instances where users entered official Sky forums/chats to understand why they had been suddenly liquidated, despite historically comfortable collateralization ratios (<a href="https://forum.makerdao.com/t/an-assessment-first-hand-experience-and-recommendations-from-the-aave-offboarding/11836">https://forum.makerdao.com/t/an-assessment-first-hand-experience-and-recommendations-from-the-aave-offboarding/11836</a>). This is, understandably, a poor user experience. Even with liquidation penalties set to 0%, the forced unwinding of levered positions conceivably can result in user losses, as well as potentially taxable events. This Section defines procedures concerning the dissemination of information about upcoming collateral offboarding on a best-effort basis. The objective is to minimize the number of users who are unaware of the offboarding prior to getting their positions liquidated.

            far more specific and concrete. For that reason, Action Tenet Supporting Documents may not be
            necessary for a particular Core Document. This is not a hard-coded rule, however. The determination
            of whether an Action Tenet Document is needed for any given Atlas document should always be
            tailor-made.Action Tenet Documents should be created and updated as necessary to reflect changes in
            governance practices, provide clarity on decision-making processes, and enhance understanding of
            governance principles and rules. The examples should not contradict their Target Document or other

            The Target Document fails to specify accountability measures for an AC who commits a misaligned act
            that is not mild. The Target Document is also silent on the subject of the proper remedial approach
            if an AC commits a subsequent misaligned act after an initial mild breach. The language does imply
            subsequent breaches should be treated with increasing severity.Despite the lack of explicit
            guidance, however, Facilitators have likely been given sufficient information in <dfn>A.1.4</dfn> to reach a
            reliable adjudication principle. Taken in its totality, the above cited Article requires
            Facilitators to take a highly aggressive stance when it comes to responding to AC misalignment risk.
            The absence of a substantial punitive measure for the first mild breach provides the AC with an
            opportunity for corrective action and learning. After the initial warning, any subsequent breach
            must immediately trigger derecognition, regardless of the degree of severity. Similarly, an initial
            breach that is not mild in scope or impact must trigger derecognition. This escalation is a
            necessary consequence of the Atlas's mandate that ACs are held to the highest standards of Universal
            Alignment.

            The Target Document is violated if an Alignment Conserver formally occupies two or more Sky ecosystem roles. The phrase "other ecosystem roles" is read in its broadest sense to mean the totality of roles that are formally defined in the Atlas with a function in the Sky ecosystem. Such "ecosystem roles" include, but are not limited to, Alignment Conserver, Governance Process Support Ecosystem Actor, Active or Incubating Ecosystem Actor, Agent Advisor, Arranger, and the contributors supporting these aforementioned actors. The rationale of this rule is to protect against misalignment risks that arise when a stakeholder occupies two or more ecosystem roles, each of which has different mandates and inner incentives. Such misalignment risks include conflict of interest and bias, collusion and conspiracy.

          <td>Entity was an Aligned Delegate. Entity then secured a second role with an Ecosystem Actor providing
            Executive spell crafting services, specifically as an "on call" dev. Entity claims it has never been
            on active duty in the second role; rather, they have only ever been on "standby" in that role. Thus,
            Entity argued it did not violate the Target Document despite holding two ecosystem roles. During its
            investigation, the Facilitator discovered evidence that, despite the EA having a general policy that
            "on call" devs are paid only a nominal fee for the bounded time periods they are on call, Entity had
            been receiving an inordinately large compensation from the EA. When the Facilitator pressed both the

            In contrast to the original Scenario, the Facilitator uncovered evidence that indicates Entity was
            not, as claimed, a mere "on call" dev, but rather was engaged in substantive work to justify the
            large compensation amount. That the Facilitator was stonewalled in its investigation also is a
            strong indication of malign intent on the part of Entity and the EA. Yet, there is no concrete proof
            of this. Under these circumstances, it is reasonable to extrapolate that derecognition from the AC
            role would suffice, per <dfn>A.1.4
              - Alignment Conservers - Accountability And Misalignment Handling - AC Derecognition</dfn>.The
            concern remains that, potentially, a bad actor can continue to exploit the ecosystem, especially if
            other ecosystem participants are not aware of their questionable history. To mitigate this risk, the
            Facilitator can include details about the evidence it discovered in its formal derecognition notice,
            which can impact the reputation score of Entity.

            instance: if two AEPs amend different sections of the Atlas but have implications that could lead to
            contradictory outcomes, how should the Governance Facilitators identify and address this indirect
            conflict?What if one AEP effects a significant overhaul of an Atlas document, while another effects
            minor tweaks to the same component? How do the Facilitators determine which elements of which AEP
            should take precedence?If one AEP drew more support than the other, does this automatically mean the
            former is the best update? What if the former AEP was authored by an unknown author, while the
            second AEP was authored by a well-known community member with high reputation?If merging proposals
            in this fashion becomes a common practice, what issues could arise? There is a risk of governance
            paralysis, where no significant progress can be made because of a loop of constant revisions and
            counter-revisions. Community fatigue could set in, where stakeholders become disengaged from the
            governance process due to the perception that decisions are never final. The continuous cycle of
            evaluating, merging, and discarding parts of conflicting AEPs is not only time-consuming but also
            increases the complexity of governance operations.If the Governance Facilitators merge parts of two
            approved, but conflicting AEPs, and the final merged product significantly deviates from the
            original intents of both, the representation of SKY voters' will becomes a compelling question.</td>

          <td>Spark is an Agent focused on building on USDS in the Ethereum and adjacent DeFi ecosystem. This includes driving adoption of USDS and deploying collateral backing USDS at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Spark does this through the Spark Liquidity Layer, SparkLend, and Spark Savings.- The Spark Liquidity Layer directly provides USDS, sUSDS, and USDC liquidity across networks and DeFi markets.- SparkLend is a lending market focused on USDS borrowing, sourcing liquidity directly from Sky to provide the best borrow rates for USDS.- Spark Savings enables stablecoin holders to earn the best risk-adjusted rate in DeFi, at large scale, with minimal liquidity constraints.</td>

Variable Slope 2 - the rate at 100% utilization, 4. Utilization - the utilization itself.<br>The Base Rate, Slope 1, and Slope 2 parameters are further defined in: <dfn>Base Rate Definition</dfn>; <dfn>Slope 1 Definition</dfn>; and <dfn>Slope 2 Definition</dfn>. All markets except Dai use this IRM. The IRM for Dai is independent of utilization and is defined as a spread over the Sky Savings Rate set forth in <dfn>A.3.2 - Core Stability Parameters - Parameters - Sky Savings Rate</dfn>. The spread is determined by the Stability Facilitators, in consultation with the Stability Scope Advisors.

            Before the launch of Agent tokens, Sky Governance is temporarily responsible for paying out a "virtual revenue share" on behalf of Spark Protocol. It is calculated by taking the total amount of Dai borrowed from Spark Protocol, and then assuming a "virtual income" equivalent to 1% of this supply, and calculating a revenue share of 10% on that basis. The calculations and payments must be done manually by the Support Facilitators at the end of each quarter. As an example: if, before the launch of Agent tokens, 200 million Dai is borrowed on Spark Protocol, then the virtual income is 1% of 200 million Dai, which gives 2 million Dai; and of that 2 million Dai the virtual revenue share is 200,000 Dai. This 200,000 Dai must be paid out in incremental payments each quarter directly by Sky Governance from the Sky Surplus Buffer to a smart contract under the control of Aave Governance. If, before the launch of Agent tokens, less than 100 million Dai is borrowed from Spark Protocol by the Sky Protocol, accrual towards the virtual revenue share payments are paused (unpaid virtual revenue share that already accrued is still paid out at the end of the quarter), and the counting down of the revenue share duration is paused. The virtual revenue share payments and the counting down of the remaining revenue share duration is resumed when at least 100 million Dai is again borrowed from Spark Protocol by the Sky Protocol. Once SPK tokens launch, the virtual revenue share system will be discontinued, and the standard rules of the Spark Protocol Aave Revenue Share Ecosystem Agreement shall take effect. See <dfn>Standard Agreement Post SPK Launch</dfn>.

The revenue share payments and the counting down of the remaining revenue share duration is resumed when Spark Protocol is generating more than 1 million Dai per year in income again.</td>

Users of the platform will receive an airdrop of SPK tokens, depending on how much and how long they have used the platform during the pre-launch token reward period. These rewards are only for users on Ethereum Mainnet. There are two seasons of the Spark pre-launch token rewards: Season 1 and Season 2. Season 1 of pre-launch token rewards was active from August 20 2023 and lasted for nine months, ending on May 20 2024. 130,434,783 SPK tokens were allocated in this period. In Season 2 14,478,261 SPK will be rewarded per month to SparkLend users who qualify for the airdrop. Season 2 is an additional pre-farming period, which runs until the Spark Agent launches as part of Sky Endgame launch season. The monthly SPK rewards are allocated as follows:◦ 80 % is allocated to users borrowing DAI and/or USDS◦ 20 % is allocated to users supplying ETHThe proposed full anti-cheat SPK Airdrop for SparkLend is calculated using the following formula:Airdrop = 80% * (DAI Borrows + USDS Borrows - sDAI Supplies * sDAI Liquidation Threshold - sUSDS Supplies * sUSDS Liquidation Threshold) + 20% * (ETH Supplies - ETH Borrows / ETH Liquidation Threshold)All supplies and borrows are denominated in USD based on the on-chain oracle price at that block to determine the conversion.</td>
