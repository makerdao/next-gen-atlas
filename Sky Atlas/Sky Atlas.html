          <td>Core</td>
          <td>The distinction between the "letter of the rule" and the "spirit of the rule" refers to whether an
            individual interprets and follows a rule strictly based on its precise wording, or instead also
            considers its underlying intent or larger purpose. The Universal Alignment Assumption holds that the
            underlying intent of rules always aims to serve human values and promote public benefit within a
            given context.A "letter of the rule" interpretation adheres strictly to the rule's language, often
            exploiting ambiguities or loopholes to achieve a specific outcome. This approach allows the rule's
            exact wording, even if flawed or misaligned with its goals, to dictate the result, particularly if
            it benefits the interpreter.A "spirit of the rule" interpretation seeks to comprehend the rule's
            true purpose and how it contributes to Universal Alignment, while remaining bound by the letter of
            the rule. When faced with inconsistencies or errors in the rule's language, this approach appeals to
            a pre-established method for disabling, disregarding or substituting the rule as needed to prevent
            outcomes that contradict its intended objective and the greater purpose it serves.Example:Imagine a
            large corporation discovers a loophole in the environmental regulation of its jurisdiction that
            allows them to generate profits by using a specific type of pollutant that isn't regulated as a
            greenhouse gas, but is as harmful as regulated greenhouse gasses.By exploiting the "letter of the
            rule," the corporation complies with the regulations on paper but continues to harm the environment
            and public health in practice.A universally aligned actor, such as an environmentally conscious
            competitor, would interpret the regulations based on their "spirit" or underlying purpose -
            protecting the environment and public health. Recognizing that exploiting the loophole contradicts
            the regulations' intent, the universally aligned actor would voluntarily choose not to emit the
            harmful pollutant, even though doing so might be profitable and technically legal. A universally
            aligned actor would also actively work with the government and other stakeholders to close the
            loophole and strengthen the regulations to ensure that they effectively serve their intended
            purpose, and to protect themselves from misaligned competitors.</td>

            In the interim, other Scope Facilitators must step in temporarily to coordinate emergency response.<br> The initiation of derecognition is done at the discretion 
            of the Support Facilitators (or other Scope Facilitator) and the Protocol Security Workstream Lead. However, the Support Facilitators and Protocol Security 
            Workstream Lead may not proceed with removal unless it is supported with clear documentation. Such documentation must be made available to all Emergency Response 
            Group Members for review.<br> When an Alignment Conserver is removed from the Emergency Response Group and derecognized for deficient performance, the Governance 
            Facilitators must transparently announce this action pursuant to A.1.4 - Alignment Conservers - Accountability And Misalignment Handling - Derecognition Notice.<br> 
            The Support Facilitators have the discretion to decide if documentation supporting the Alignment Conserver’s derecognition and removal should be retained internally

            Vote would leave the ecosystem vulnerable to harm (e.g., an exploit).<br> The multisig should be used to 
            prevent technical vulnerabilities; prevent unwanted functionality of the smart contracts or corresponding 
            parts of the system (e.g., price oracles); or prevent unwanted usage of the smart contracts or corresponding 
            parts of the system which deviates from intended behavior.<br> The multisig can also be used in cases where 
            a vulnerability or exploit is discovered in other protocols using the same codebase as SparkLend, and a 
            timely action can prevent or mitigate the damage.<br> The Governance Facilitators must ensure that use of 
            the multisig is generally aligned and specifically accords with the requirements defined herein.

              Response System - Emergency Response - Emergency Response Signal Group</dfn>.

            Voting depending on the topic. The voting period of a given Governance Poll varies; the most common
            are three (3) and fourteen (14) day periods. Concurrently-posted polls do not necessarily have the

          <td>An Executive Vote (also "Executive") is a formalized governance proposal that requires on-chain

            Executive proposals that pertain to operations maintaining the Protocol. Executive Votes execute
            technical changes to the Sky Protocol.The Executive Vote occurs approximately every two weeks. Its
            contents are often determined by weekly Governance Polls that pre-approve the inclusion of proposals
            in the Executive Vote. However, the Atlas can explicitly authorize proposals to go directly to an
            Executive Vote.Note that the terms 'Executive' and 'spell' are distinct concepts. The term
            'Executive' or 'Executive Vote' is used in all instances where the formal governance vote is being
            referenced. The term 'Executive Process' refers to the end-to-end process of the development of an
            Executive Vote, in which Facilitators, spell teams (also referred to collectively as the "Governance
            Security Engineering Team") and other recognized Ecosystem Actors participate. The term 'spell'
            refers to the smart contract that executes the changes to the protocol approved by Sky Governance in
            an Executive Vote. Generally, when referring to spell team operations and their technical outcome or
            product (including code base, code operations, code reviews and code quality), the term 'spell' will
            be used. The term 'spell process' refers to the end-to-end process of developing a spell, a process
            in which the Governance Facilitators and the current spell team participate. The term 'spell
            development process' is a subset of the 'spell process' and pertains solely to the technical

            If the vote is successful, the Agent Artifact is officially upgraded with a Primitive Instance, which latter has its own independent Status that is distinct from the Primitive's Global Activation Status.

This upgrade means that the respective Primitive(s) is formally integrated into the Agent's Artifact and the Atlas as a whole; the Star Agent can now operationalize the Primitive's special functionality.

Additionally, Core GovOps performs a further review to confirm that all the documents created by the Founder using Founder Access are well-specified, that the documents are Aligned, and that all necessary Primitives have been Activated. The necessary Primitives are the Agent Creation, Star/Executor Transformation, Agent Token, Executor Accord, and Root Edit Primitives. In addition, at least one of the Distribution Requirement or the Market Cap Fee Primitives must be Activated. (See <dfn>A.2.4 - Founder Required Primitive Activation</dfn>.)

           The Upkeep Rebate Primitive allows a Star Agent (”Holding Agent”) to claim a rebate on its Ecosystem Upkeep Fees when it holds any portion of the token supply of another Star Agent (”Issuing Agent”). Ecosystem Upkeep Fees are accounted on a monthly basis. The Upkeep Rebate is calculated on the same cadence per Holding Agent as follows: (1) The Holding Agent’s share of the Issuing Agent’s token supply at the time the Issuing Agent pays its Ecosystem Upkeep Fees, multiplied by (2) The total monthly Ecosystem Upkeep Fees paid by the Issuing Agent. For a Star Agent deploying the Distribution Requirement Primitive, the value of its total monthly Ecosystem Upkeep Fee is calculated pursuant to <dfn>A.2.4 - Calculation of Distributed Tokens</dfn>. For a Star Agent deploying the Market Cap Fee Primitive, the value of its total monthly Ecosystem Upkeep Fee is calculated pursuant to <dfn>A.2.4 - Valuation</dfn>.

            Integration Boost Partners must submit net deposit data in such a form that the data can be verified by Sky using on-chain data. In the short term, Ecosystem Actor BA Labs calculates the net deposit data based on on-chain events and makes it available to Operational GovOps through an API endpoint. The API endpoint is <a href="https://info-sky.blockanalitica.com/api/v1/incentivized-pools/">https://info-sky.blockanalitica.com/api/v1/incentivized-pools/</a> for Integration Boost Partners on Ethereum and <a href="https://info-sky.blockanalitica.com/api/v1/solana-incentives/">https://info-sky.blockanalitica.com/api/v1/solana-incentives/</a> on Solana. In the long term, Operational GovOps assumes responsibility for ensuring that the data submission meets the on-chain verifiability requirement; this is done as part of their review of Invocations of the Integration Boost Primitive.

This minimizes the role of Sky Core in Integration Boost payments and emphasizes the primary role of the Operational Executor Agent, acting through Operational GovOps, in implementing the Sky Primitives.

          <td>A Star Agent's internal TRC management system should possess the following capabilities to meet the objectives outlined in <dfn>A.2.4 - Objective of Star TRC Management</dfn>.
            <ol>
              <li><p>Star Agents' internal TRC management systems should enable compliant sourcing and tracking of all TRC components, including Internal Junior Risk Capital (IJRC), Star-External Junior Risk Capital (SEJRC), Tokenized External Junior Risk Capital (TEJRC), and Originated Senior Risk Capital (OSRC). Compliance in this context includes strict adherence to eligibility criteria and capital-sourcing ratios (e.g., External Per Internal, Senior Per Junior) as defined in the Atlas. See <dfn>A.3.3 - Total Risk Capital Sourcing Ratios</dfn>.</p><p>The system must provide real-time or near real-time tracking of all held Total Risk Capital (TRC) components. This includes, for each TRC component:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Accurate valuation of the assets comprising each component.</li>
                  <li>Clear identification of the source of each component (e.g., Star's own SubProxy for IJRC, specific Ecosystem Accord references for rented SEJRC or OSRC, TEJRC encumbrance details, OSRC origination details).</li>
                  <li>Verification of each TRC component's eligibility status according to Atlas rules. This includes tracking whether capital is "enabled" or "active" for RRC coverage purposes (e.g., based on Ecosystem Accord status, compliance with sourcing ratios, etc.).</li>
                  <li>Distinction between capital directly held by the Star Agent and capital that is encumbered (e.g., SEJRC where the lending Star retains custody but the capital is contractually committed).</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Star Agents' internal TRC management systems should enable dynamic-state accounting. The system must account for TRC components that are in dynamic, pending, or off-chain states, as these can impact the true risk capital available to a Star Agent. This includes:
                <ul>
                  <li>Pending transactions such as SEJRC or OSRC rental Ecosystem Accords that have been committed to by the parties, but not yet codified in the Atlas.</li>
                  <li>Capital in transit, e.g., assets that are committed to be IJRC, but currently moving between chains via bridges or locked in Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) messages awaiting finality.</li>
                  <li>Operational expenditures funded by TRC components (typically IJRC), such as blockchain transaction fees, oracle service fees, audit costs, and other operational overhead that reduces available risk capital. The system should track these expenditures in real-time or near real-time.</li>
                  <li>Any off-chain factors that could impair the immediate deployability or availability of TRC components.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Star Agents' internal TRC management systems should enable continuous capital adequacy monitoring. The system must enable the near real-time comparison of the Star Agent's internally tracked and calculated TRC against its official Aggregate RRC, as obtained from the Sky Core RRC Dashboard/API. See <dfn>A.2.4 - Sky Core Required Risk Capital (RRC) Dashboard And API</dfn>. This core functionality is essential for the Star Agent to proactively monitor its capital adequacy, identify potential or actual TRC shortfalls, and make timely operational and capital management decisions to maintain compliance.</li>
              <li><p>Star Agents' internal TRC management systems should define a RRC-incident (e.g., TRC shortfall) response protocol. The system should enable internal alerting mechanisms that detect when a Star Agent's TRC approaches predefined internal buffer thresholds relative to its Aggregate RRC. See <dfn>A.3.3 - Risk Tolerance Ratio</dfn>. The system should also detect an actual shortfall where the Star Agent's held TRC falls below its Aggregate RRC.</p><p>Furthermore, Star Agent teams should establish and document internal processes for responding to such alerts. Such internal processes should include:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>internal escalation and assessment of the shortfall's cause and magnitude;</li>
                  <li>formulation of potential responses or corrective actions, which may include sourcing additional TRC, reducing risk-weighted exposures, or other measures;</li>
                  <li>internal decision-making framework for the evaluation of potential responses and selection of the most appropriate one; and</li>
                  <li>notifying any pertinent parties (Operational GovOps) as needed for the purpose of planning or implementing follow-up action.</li>
                </ol>
              Star Agent teams' internal decision-making framework may consider the economic trade-offs of various actions, including the strategic acceptance of penalties for a TRC shortfall where such an approach is determined to be economically advantageous compared to immediate rebalancing (e.g., avoiding excessive transaction costs or market impact).</li>

          <td><p>Star Agents are required to periodically submit TRC Reports to Core GovOps. This report serves a dual purpose. It provides a verifiable snapshot of the Star Agent's TRC composition and key capital ratios as of the end of the reporting period; and second, it provides a formal attestation regarding the Star Agent's maintenance of TRC at or above its dynamically changing Aggregate Required Risk Capital (RRC) throughout the entire reporting period. See <dfn>A.3.3 - Aggregate RRC</dfn>.</p><p>This comprehensive reporting, encompassing both an end-of-period statement and disclosures of any intra-period events affecting TRC, is essential. On-chain data alone (such as that captured by the planned OVRC system) cannot definitively prove the full eligibility and unimpaired availability of a Star Agent's capital position for continuous RRC coverage, nor can it capture all off-chain factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, whether assets are subject to Star-initiated off-chain contractual pledges, if the economic value or redeemability of its bridged assets is compromised by issues with their originating bridge, or if its assets are encumbered by derivative structures or other off-chain commitments that would impair their immediate use at any point during the period.</p><p>The TRC Report serves as an important basis for Core GovOps' verification procedures. This entails: 1) reconciling reported end-of-period TRC components against the Sky Atlas, on-chain data, and other relevant sources to validate the period-end capital position and adherence to Atlas-defined capital requirements; and 2) reviewing Star Agents' attestations and disclosures regarding its TRC management and any material events throughout the reporting period to assess continuous compliance with its dynamically changing Aggregate RRC. The outcome of this validation is a critical input for the monthly settlement cycles, which latter includes the determination and retroactive application of penalties for any identified discrepancies or violations of capital requirements during the period.</p><p>The long-term vision is for the Powerhouse system to enable the automation of TRC data aggregation and verification. The Powerhouse system will have capabilities such as directly querying Star Agent SubProxy accounts for IJRC assets, programmatically accessing and interpreting Ecosystem Accords recorded in the Atlas, interfacing with TEJRC and OSRC smart contract systems, and automatically applying Atlas-defined eligibility rules. See <dfn>A.2.4 - Continuous Monitoring Of On-chain Verifiable Risk Capital (OVRC)</dfn>. Even in this advanced state, the TRC Report, or a similar form of periodic attestation, may remain necessary to cover elements of TRC verification that are not fully able to be automated or require explicit Star Agent declaration.</p></td>

This calculation serves the purposes of system monitoring, data gathering, and framework calibration. However, throughout this interim phase, such calculated penalties will not be formally assessed against Star Agents, and consequently, Star Agents will not be required to make payment for these penalties.

            The Stability Fee parameter is an annual percentage fee charged on the Dai generated on Vaults. It is expressed as an annual percentage yield but it is charged on a per-block basis in Dai. The Dai from this fee is minted, added to the Dai debt for the vault, and then transferred into the Surplus Buffer which is under the control of Sky Governance. Each vault type has its own Stability Fee that can be adjusted by the Stability Facilitators. The Stability Facilitators must regularly update Vault Types' Stability Fee according to requirements defined in the subdocuments below. The Stability Scope Advisors must develop a Rate System which can be used to set various interest rates, including the rates for Core Crypto vaults and the minimum lending rate for future Agents. The Rate System must be based on external benchmarks including the risk-free rate and the highest current sustainable rate in crypto financial markets. These rates should act as the lowest and highest base rates to which additional spreads can be added to better reflect the risks involved in specific lending activities. The Rate System must be dynamic, based on the state of Actively Stabilizing Collateral in the system, and naturally move the state towards the required level of Actively Stabilizing Collateral defined in <dfn>A.3.4</dfn>.

            Periodically, collateral and vault types (ilks) are re-evaluated, which sometimes results in an offboarding of that collateral or vault type. There have been several instances where users entered official Sky forums/chats to understand why they had been suddenly liquidated, despite historically comfortable collateralization ratios (<a href="https://forum.makerdao.com/t/an-assessment-first-hand-experience-and-recommendations-from-the-aave-offboarding/11836">https://forum.makerdao.com/t/an-assessment-first-hand-experience-and-recommendations-from-the-aave-offboarding/11836</a>). This is, understandably, a poor user experience. Even with liquidation penalties set to 0%, the forced unwinding of levered positions conceivably can result in user losses, as well as potentially taxable events. This Section defines procedures concerning the dissemination of information about upcoming collateral offboarding on a best-effort basis. The objective is to minimize the number of users who are unaware of the offboarding prior to getting their positions liquidated.

            the benefits gained from, adhering to the Tenet. When facing edge cases, these policy statements can

          <td>Facilitator Action Tenet Documents are likely to be necessary supplements for interpreting the
            Immutable Document types, as these tend to have generalized, broad language. The Core Document type
            has the function of operationalizing the Immutable Documents, and thus its language will tend to be
            far more specific and concrete. For that reason, Action Tenet Supporting Documents may not be
            necessary for a particular Core Document. This is not a hard-coded rule, however. The determination
            of whether an Action Tenet Document is needed for any given Atlas document should always be
            tailor-made.Action Tenet Documents should be created and updated as necessary to reflect changes in
            governance practices, provide clarity on decision-making processes, and enhance understanding of
            governance principles and rules. The examples should not contradict their Target Document or other
            Supporting Documents of the Target Document.If the Action Tenet can be anchored to a specific term
            from the Target Document, that term is listed first; followed by a hyphen; and then, an abstract of
            the Action Tenet logic, e.g.: "Organizational Drift - ACs' Mandate When Instigating Action Can Be
            Traced Back to a Discrete Entity". If the Action Tenet cannot be anchored to a specific term from
            the Target Document, the "Name" property should simply summarize the Action Tenet logic, e.g.:
            "Evaluating AC breach of role-specific requirement vs. general requirement".</td>

            The Target Document fails to specify accountability measures for an AC who commits a misaligned act
            that is not mild. The Target Document is also silent on the subject of the proper remedial approach
            if an AC commits a subsequent misaligned act after an initial mild breach. The language does imply
            subsequent breaches should be treated with increasing severity.Despite the lack of explicit
            guidance, however, Facilitators have likely been given sufficient information in <dfn>A.1.4</dfn> to reach a
            reliable adjudication principle. Taken in its totality, the above cited Article requires
            Facilitators to take a highly aggressive stance when it comes to responding to AC misalignment risk.
            The absence of a substantial punitive measure for the first mild breach provides the AC with an
            opportunity for corrective action and learning. After the initial warning, any subsequent breach
            must immediately trigger derecognition, regardless of the degree of severity. Similarly, an initial
            breach that is not mild in scope or impact must trigger derecognition. This escalation is a
            necessary consequence of the Atlas's mandate that ACs are held to the highest standards of Universal
            Alignment.

          <td>Scenario Variation</td>
          <td>Entity was an Aligned Delegate. Entity then secured a second role with an Ecosystem Actor providing
            Executive spell crafting services, specifically as an "on call" dev. Entity claims it has never been
            on active duty in the second role; rather, they have only ever been on "standby" in that role. Thus,
            Entity argued it did not violate the Target Document despite holding two ecosystem roles. During its
            investigation, the Facilitator discovered evidence that, despite the EA having a general policy that
            "on call" devs are paid only a nominal fee for the bounded time periods they are on call, Entity had
            been receiving an inordinately large compensation from the EA. When the Facilitator pressed both the
            EA and Entity for an explanation, none was given.</td>
          <td>Misaligned as to Entity.</td>
          <td>
            In contrast to the original Scenario, the Facilitator uncovered evidence that indicates Entity was
            not, as claimed, a mere "on call" dev, but rather was engaged in substantive work to justify the
            large compensation amount. That the Facilitator was stonewalled in its investigation also is a
            strong indication of malign intent on the part of Entity and the EA. Yet, there is no concrete proof
            of this. Under these circumstances, it is reasonable to extrapolate that derecognition from the AC
            role would suffice, per <dfn>A.1.4
              - Alignment Conservers - Accountability And Misalignment Handling - AC Derecognition</dfn>.The
            concern remains that, potentially, a bad actor can continue to exploit the ecosystem, especially if
            other ecosystem participants are not aware of their questionable history. To mitigate this risk, the
            Facilitator can include details about the evidence it discovered in its formal derecognition notice,
            which can impact the reputation score of Entity.

            list Entity as an active team member on the Facilitator team. During the Governance Facilitator's
            investigation, Entity claimed it had sent the Facilitator a resignation email, but could not provide
            actual proof of this. The Governance Facilitator also discovered that Entity still had permissions
            to the Facilitator team workspace. The team's Discord contained casual, non-work related

            unlike the original Scenario, Entity in this Variation continued to have access to the Facilitator
            team workspace even after the alleged date of resignation. Technically speaking, Entity is still
            formally occupying two roles with different mandates and incentives. The potential exists for
            conflict of interest, collusion, etc. The part-time role does not impact this analysis.The

            instance: if two AEPs amend different sections of the Atlas but have implications that could lead to
            contradictory outcomes, how should the Governance Facilitators identify and address this indirect
            conflict?What if one AEP effects a significant overhaul of an Atlas document, while another effects
            minor tweaks to the same component? How do the Facilitators determine which elements of which AEP
            should take precedence?If one AEP drew more support than the other, does this automatically mean the
            former is the best update? What if the former AEP was authored by an unknown author, while the
            second AEP was authored by a well-known community member with high reputation?If merging proposals
            in this fashion becomes a common practice, what issues could arise? There is a risk of governance
            paralysis, where no significant progress can be made because of a loop of constant revisions and
            counter-revisions. Community fatigue could set in, where stakeholders become disengaged from the
            governance process due to the perception that decisions are never final. The continuous cycle of
            evaluating, merging, and discarding parts of conflicting AEPs is not only time-consuming but also
            increases the complexity of governance operations.If the Governance Facilitators merge parts of two
            approved, but conflicting AEPs, and the final merged product significantly deviates from the
            original intents of both, the representation of SKY voters' will becomes a compelling question.</td>

            on AD derecognition: "The DAO could hire a security advisor firm/consultant as a Scope Advisor.
            (This could fall under the Governance Scope and its requirement for Governance Security processes.)
            Their task would be to thoroughly analyze the security needs and risks of the Alignment Conservers
            and develop ever-evolving Operational Security "Best Practices."With an explicit framework of
            agreed-upon Best Practices, all anon Alignment Conservers have a known target to meet. Further, the
            existence of an objective framework of Best Practices equips the Governance Facilitators to easily
            determine when a breach of opsec best practice has occurred. The explicit framework removes the risk
            of the Facilitators inappropriately inserting subjective bias into the decision-making process.The
            Security Scope Advisor could also assist in reviewing an informant's evidence to evaluate its
            validity/quality. The Security Scope Advisor could ensure that the methods used by the informant to
            secure the evidence were ethical. (All communications, evidence and data shared with the Security
            Scope Advisor would be under confidentiality protection). Finally, such an Advisor would have
            specialized expertise in opsec and associated matters that Governance Facilitators lack."This Needed
            Research is an extensive Research Track, given the wide-ranging implications and potential
            mechanisms around opsec best practices, and also how these should map onto the Atlas.

            be that quality contributors are a scarce resource. Further, the decentralized work paradigm
            encourages having several part-time jobs. The sharing of contributors across several Sky teams -
            such that contributors gain experience in multiple operational aspects - might arguably enhance
            ecosystem intelligence. Would it make a meaningful difference to require contributors who do wish to

          <td>Spark is an Agent focused on building on USDS in the Ethereum and adjacent DeFi ecosystem. This includes driving adoption of USDS and deploying collateral backing USDS at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Spark does this through the Spark Liquidity Layer, SparkLend, and Spark Savings.- The Spark Liquidity Layer directly provides USDS, sUSDS, and USDC liquidity across networks and DeFi markets.- SparkLend is a lending market focused on USDS borrowing, sourcing liquidity directly from Sky to provide the best borrow rates for USDS.- Spark Savings enables stablecoin holders to earn the best risk-adjusted rate in DeFi, at large scale, with minimal liquidity constraints.</td>

Utilization - the utilization itself.<br>The Base Rate, Slope 1, and Slope 2 parameters are further defined in: <dfn>Base Rate Definition</dfn>; <dfn>Slope 1 Definition</dfn>; and <dfn>Slope 2 Definition</dfn>. All markets except Dai use this IRM.

The cap automator is defined in terms of three parameters:1. gap - the target available exposure2. ttl - the cooldown period for cap increases3. max - the absolute maximum exposureAny user can permissionlessly update a covered Supply Cap or Borrow Cap so the available exposure is equal to the target, as long as the resulting exposure does not exceed the specified maximum limit and the cooldown period has elapsed in the case of increases to the Supply Cap or Borrow Cap.

            The kill switch disables all borrowing across SparkLend markets in the event of a depeg on key collateral assets. The kill switch is defined in terms of a threshold for specified pegged assets. If the ratio of the price of a specified asset to its peg is equal to or less than the threshold, then any user can trigger the kill switch to disable borrowing across all SparkLend markets. After the kill switch is triggered, markets can be reactivated by Sky Governance after resetting the kill switch. Resetting the kill switch is subject to the Governance Security Delay specified in <dfn>A.1.9 - A2 - Sky Core Governance Security - Governance Security Delay Requirements</dfn>.

            Before the launch of Agent tokens, Sky Governance is temporarily responsible for paying out a "virtual revenue share" on behalf of Spark Protocol. It is calculated by taking the total amount of Dai borrowed from Spark Protocol, and then assuming a "virtual income" equivalent to 1% of this supply, and calculating a revenue share of 10% on that basis. The calculations and payments must be done manually by the Support Facilitators at the end of each quarter. As an example: if, before the launch of Agent tokens, 200 million Dai is borrowed on Spark Protocol, then the virtual income is 1% of 200 million Dai, which gives 2 million Dai; and of that 2 million Dai the virtual revenue share is 200,000 Dai. This 200,000 Dai must be paid out in incremental payments each quarter directly by Sky Governance from the Sky Surplus Buffer to a smart contract under the control of Aave Governance. If, before the launch of Agent tokens, less than 100 million Dai is borrowed from Spark Protocol by the Sky Protocol, accrual towards the virtual revenue share payments are paused (unpaid virtual revenue share that already accrued is still paid out at the end of the quarter), and the counting down of the revenue share duration is paused. The virtual revenue share payments and the counting down of the remaining revenue share duration is resumed when at least 100 million Dai is again borrowed from Spark Protocol by the Sky Protocol. Once SPK tokens launch, the virtual revenue share system will be discontinued, and the standard rules of the Spark Protocol Aave Revenue Share Ecosystem Agreement shall take effect. See <dfn>Standard Agreement Post SPK Launch</dfn>.

Season 1 of pre-launch token rewards was active from August 20 2023 and lasted for nine months, ending on May 20 2024. 130,434,783 SPK tokens were allocated in this period. In Season 2 14,478,261 SPK will be rewarded per month to SparkLend users who qualify for the airdrop. Season 2 is an additional pre-farming period, which runs until the Spark Agent launches as part of Sky Endgame launch season. The monthly SPK rewards are allocated as follows:◦ 80 % is allocated to users borrowing DAI and/or USDS◦ 20 % is allocated to users supplying ETHThe proposed full anti-cheat SPK Airdrop for SparkLend is calculated using the following formula:Airdrop = 80% * (DAI Borrows + USDS Borrows - sDAI Supplies * sDAI Liquidation Threshold - sUSDS Supplies * sUSDS Liquidation Threshold) + 20% * (ETH Supplies - ETH Borrows / ETH Liquidation Threshold)All supplies and borrows are denominated in USD based on the on-chain oracle price at that block to determine the conversion.</td>
